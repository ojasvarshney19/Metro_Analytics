# Delhi-Metro-Network-Analysis

Metro Network Analysis involves examining the network of metro systems to understand their structure, efficiency, and effectiveness. It typically includes analyzing routes, stations, traffic, connectivity, and other operational aspects. So, if you want to learn how to analyze the metro network in a city, this article is for you. In this article, I’ll take you through the task of Delhi Metro Network Analysis using Python.

# Process We Can Follow

Analyzing the metro network in a city like Delhi helps improve urban transportation infrastructure, leading to better city planning and enhanced commuter experiences. Below is the process we can follow for the task of Metro Network Analysis of Delhi:

1. Determine what you want to achieve. It could be optimizing routes, reducing congestion, improving passenger flow, or understanding travel patterns.
2. Collect data on metro lines, stations, connections, and transit schedules.
3. Clean the data for inconsistencies, missing values, or errors.
4. Create visual representations of the network, such as route maps, passenger flow charts, or heat maps of station congestion.
5. Analyze how effectively the network handles passenger traffic and meets operational targets.

So, for the task of Delhi Metro Network Analysis, we need to have a dataset based on all metro lines in Delhi and how they connect with each other. I found an ideal dataset for this task.
I've attched the csv file in the folder itself.
